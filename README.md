The gerbers directory in this repository contains all the files you need to have a pcb house make pcbs for you. Generally, you just 'zip' the directory and upload.

You can make your own or sell it, but if you do sell versions, you must release the source publicly so we can benefit!

Still, it's simple enough :)
